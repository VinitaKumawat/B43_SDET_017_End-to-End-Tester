# B43_SDET_017_End-to-End-Tester
Automate testing for a tools demo website using Selenium. Validate UI functionality, interactions, and responsiveness. Ensure seamless user experience with efficient test scripts in Java.

##	***Introduction***

The purpose of this test plan is to outline the strategy and approach for performing end-to-end testing of the Practice Software Testing website. The testing will be automated using Selenium with the Cucumber framework, integrated with TestNG or JUnit for test execution, and Extent Reports for advanced reporting. The plan aims to ensure the reliability, consistency, and quality of the web application by validating both functional and non-functional requirements.

##	***Objectives***

•	Automate the testing of core functionalities and UI components.

•	Validate cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.

•	Perform dynamic element validation, including dropdowns, popups, and models.

•	Generate detailed reports on test execution and results.

•	Identify and document bugs effectively.

•	Provide comprehensive test documentation, including test cases, scenarios, bug reports, and summary reports.

##	***Scope***
•	Selenium for browser automation.

•	Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) and Page Object Model (POM).

•	TestNG or JUnit for test execution and management.

•	Extent Reports for advanced reporting.

•	Tools like XMind for mind mapping.

##	***Testable Features***
•	Navigation and page consistency.

•	UI components (buttons, images, forms).

•	Dynamic elements (dropdowns, popups, modals).

•	Cross-browser compatibility.

•	Core functionalities as per project requirements.

##	***Testing Approach***
•	Implement the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.

•	Write Cucumber feature files to define test scenarios.

•	Implement step definitions using Selenium WebDriver.

•	Utilize TestNG or JUnit to manage test execution.

•	Generate execution logs and reports using Extent Reports.

•	Perform cross-browser testing using Selenium Grid or cloud platforms.

## ***Test Deliverables***
•	Test Plan document

•	Feature files for BDD scenarios

•	Step definition scripts

•	TestNG/JUnit test scripts

•	Extent Reports with execution metrics and screenshots

•	Mind map for testing areas

•	Bug reports and logs

•	Summary report with test metrics and outcomes
